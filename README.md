NodeRed subflow to retrieve B2A8S20P JK BMS values

This is a NodeRed subflow that I have succesfully used with the B2A8S20P JK BMS for my personal use.
It retrieves the relevant BMS values and publishes them on MQTT.

This is freely distributable, but I bear no responsibility whatsoever for its use.
The subflow works for me but could not work for others, no warranty is implied for its use.
